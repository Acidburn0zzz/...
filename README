... - Dot Dot Dot - Unix dot file management and sharing

== INTRO

"..." is a toolset for managing sets of Unix dot files and configuring
them for a given machine.

== PREREQUISITES

    * Perl - The `...` command line tool is written in Perl, but
      requires no external Perl modules. Almost all Unix systems have a
      perl installed.

      NOTE: I would be happy to see this ported this to Bourne
            (Again) Shell. Contact me if you are interested in
            helping with that.

    * Dot Files - You'll need one or more collections of dot files. You
      can find some on github. Here is a couple examples:

      * git://github.com/ingydotnet/dotdotdot.git
      * git://github.com/socialtext/stconfig.git

    * git / svn / rsync / scp - Tools to get the dot file collections
      over to your machine.


== INSTALLATION

To install "...", run these commands in your Unix shell:

    > cd $HOME
    > git clone git://github.com/ingydotnet/....git
    > cd .../src
    > # Get collections of dot files from various places
    > git clone git://github.com/ingydotnet/dotdotdot.git ingy
    > svn checkout some/svn/dot/file/repo stuff
    > cd ..
    > cp conf.example conf
    > vim conf              # Edit the ... configuration file
    > ...                   # Show ... help info
    > ... backup            # Backup your existing dot files
    > ... install           # Install your new dot files
