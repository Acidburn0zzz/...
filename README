... - Dot Dot Dot - Unix dot file management and sharing

== INTRO

"..." is a toolset for managing sets of Unix dot files and configuring
them for a given machine.

== PREREQUISITES

The `...` comand requires the following standard Unix tools in your PATH:

    * perl (any old version since 1998)
    * cpio

You'll need one or more collections of dot files. Here's a couple I know
about.

    * git://github.com/ingydotnet/dotdotdot.git
    * git://github.com/socialtext/stconfig.git

You can round up your own bunch too. (Consider sharing them with the
public, on a nice place like github.)


== INSTALLATION

To install "...", run these commands in your Unix shell:

    > cd $HOME
    > git clone git://github.com/ingydotnet/....git
    > cd .../src
    > # Get collections of dot files from various places
    > git clone git://github.com/ingydotnet/dotdotdot.git ingy
    > svn checkout your/svn/dot/file/repo stuff
    > cd ..
    > cp conf.example conf
    > vim conf              # Edit the ... configuration file
    > cd $HOME
    > .../bin/... -h        # Show ... help info
    > .../bin/... backup    # Backup your existing dot files
    > .../bin/... install   # Install your new dot files
    > exec bash
    > ... upgrade
